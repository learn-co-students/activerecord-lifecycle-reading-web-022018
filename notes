#similar to how you use has_many or validates#They are at the top of your model files.
before_save   called after validation occurs #non model attribute , then use before_save.
before_validation Whenever you are modifying an attribute of the model, use before_validation
before_create. close to before_save with one major difference: it only gets called when a model is created for the first time. This means not every time the object is persisted, just when it is new.

before_validation we want to run this whenever someone tries to save to the database. This is where the before_save
before_save whenever you save to the database, let's send an email to the Author alerting them that the post was just saved!
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
  validate :is_title_case
  before_validation :make_title_case  ########### New Code!! #could be before_save
  before_save :email_author_about_post
  private
  def is_title_case
    if title.split.any?{|w|w[0].upcase != w[0]} errors.add(:title, "Title must be in title case") end
  end
  def make_title_case  self.title = self.title.titlecase end
end
